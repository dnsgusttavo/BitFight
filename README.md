## :interrobang: The Game

BitFigth is a indie game developed by me [@dnsgusttavo](https://ithub.com/dnsgusttavo) . It's a amazing 2d side view game in pixel style. The base idea is a PvP fight game, in order to eliminate the opnente and for that you can use the bonuses that will be dropped by the mobs of the game.
